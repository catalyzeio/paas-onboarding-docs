HIPAA compliance is painful. Achieving HIPAA compliance is a major effort for our customers. Many customers have applications and backends in which they have invested thousands of hours of work that they need to maintain. Other customers are just beginning application development and need a place to start. For all of these customers, we offer a standardized platform on which to host their applications. The platform takes care of all the prerequisites for HIPAA compliance while adding useful features like dedicated logging and monitoring. This offering has generated a lot of interest, which is not surprising given the features offered in combination with our core competencies.

The first few customers that signed on to the platform were migrated, deployed, and managed completely manually. This is a good way to prove out the utility of the platform but is incredibly difficult to scale to support more customers. Rather than using a brute-force approach to growing the platform (adding hordes of staff), we started working on ways to automate deploying and managing customers environments. The end result draws heavy inspiration from [Heroku](http://www.heroku.com) with some unique twists to satisfy the additions needed for HIPAA compliance.
