The largest [value](//www.quora.com/In-lay-man-terms-what-is-the-value-that-Heroku-brings-to-the-user-I-presume-that-anyone-can-install-and-host-Ruby-on-any-servers-Then-what-makes-Heroku-so-special) that a platform as a service provides is simplification. "A day in the life" of a developer in 2015 typically includes *some* type of server management or configuration. If that developer happens to be working on a healthcare application, the additional requirements around complying with regulations, mandates and certifications (HIPAA, HITRUST etc.) make the developer's job even more complex.

Outside of healthcare, a developer using a platform such as [Heroku](//www.heroku.com) no longer has to manage the complexities and nuances of deployment and service configuration. Before Catalyze this ease of use inside of the healthcare development industry just didn't exist.

We want to make it as easy for a developer to build a compliant healthcare application on Catalyze as it is for a developer building a consumer facing application to deploy on [Heroku](http://www.heroku.com). With this goal in mind, we set out to design and build out the Catalyze Platform as a Service.

#### Catalyze makes it easy to deploy, secure and scale apps in the cloud. Catalyze gets out of the way—allowing you to build things your way, with the tools you love—with the assurance that your hosting environment will be HIPAA compliant and HITRUST certified.

The Catalyze Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) is built on top of existing IaaS vendors such as Amazon Web Services and Rackspace. It manages:

* web servers
* application servers
* database servers

It goes further by setting up and securing:

* encrypted network connections
* disk encryption
* encrypted backups
* disaster recovery
* dedicated logging servers
* dedicated monitoring servers

Each of these will be explained in more detail in subsequent sections.
